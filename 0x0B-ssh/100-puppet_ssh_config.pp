# Letâ€™s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. 
# Just as in the previous configuration file task, 
# weâ€™d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.

# Requirements:

# Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
# Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
